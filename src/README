Usage instructions for Ubuntu linux operating system:
1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A-B style USB cable.
2. Ensure that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/dev/ttyACM0 or -ACM1).
3. In the directory containing the files, use commands "make upload && serial-mon"
to upload the code to the Arduino and view the serial monitor.
4. Use (Ctrl- a + z + e) to start local echo.
5. Follow on-screen instructions.

for showing the basics of the stack and evaluation of infix expressions

Assumptions:
* That the variable z is used as a placeholder for the independent variable that will be used to graph the
dependent variable y such that y = y(z)
* That the types of brackets used are open ()... this is to remain consistent with common calculators' notation (desmos, texas instruments etc.)
* The the list of functions include only:
>tan, sin, cos, exp, log (natural logarithm), atan, acos, asin, tanh, sinh, and cosh
>also general polynomials can be handled with the exception of those that are limited by the pow functions such as cube roots
* There are only non-sophisticated user input error detection measures in place including:
>parentheses checking, wrong variable checking, and unknown character detection

Problems:
* Issues with log and tan functions such that they cause minor visual glitches
* Issues vertical asymptotes on really large domains (tanx) for large domains) being visible
* Because the dtostrf() requires the programmer to make sure that it has enough storage for the values, there is a restriction
on the number of digits to the double number digits, but the amount of digits it that is hardcoded as of now is 50, which is quite generous
* "...pow cannot be used to obtain a root of a negative number..." from http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/pow

Essential Parts:
* Processor:
 1 x Arduino Mega Microcontroller
 1 x USB cable, 0.5m to 1.0m length, A-B Style

* Breadboard:
 1 x 10" x 8.5" x 2.5" ESD SHIPPER box
 1 x Base Plate + Mega Mounting Hardware (3 x bolt+spacer+nut)
 4 x stick-on feet.  Peel off the paper on the back of the board (tearing
    it around the nuts) and then stick the feet on the 4 corners.
 1 x 70 pcs 22 AWG solid jumper wire assortment
 1 x Single Panel Breadboard - attach this to the left of the Mega processor
    with the number 1 pin to the top left.

* LCD Display:
 1 x Adafruit 2.4" TFT LCD with Touchscreen Breakout w/MicroSD Socket 
    (ILI9341) part number 2478
 2 x bolt+nut - The two small bolts and nuts are used for legs to hold the
    display level with the breadboard.
 1 x Kingston flash memory card - 8 GB - microSDHC

LCD Wiring instructions:
* Wiring: from bottom to top on the right side (the side with the pins).
