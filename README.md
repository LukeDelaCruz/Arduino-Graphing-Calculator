# Graphing Calculator via Arduino Mega 2560

If you have the arduino setup as per the readme instructions then it's time to compile and run the code. I strongly recommend PlatformIO for Atom text editor found [here](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#ide-atom) as a universal arduino IDE because it does not require PlatformIO core, but does require Python 2.7.

If you don't want to go through all the setup hassle (or don't own this specific Arduino) feel free to check out a quick demo [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ue2hyfX6E98dUeu53).
